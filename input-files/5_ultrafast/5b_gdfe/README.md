# GdFe 

This folder contains some input files for simulating the thermally induced ultrafast magnetic switching (TIMS) of GdFe via a heat pulse, using the two-temperature model. This refers to the `laser-pulse` program within vampire. 

You can copy these files to the `working` directory and run vampire there. This will give you an output file called `output`, the contents of which are defined by the input file. 

Plotting this output should allow you to see the two sublattices, which are antiferromagnetically coupled, switch magnetisation directions after the pulse. Remember that plotting the magnitude won't let you see this transition.
