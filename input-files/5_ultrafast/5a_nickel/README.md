# Nickel

This folder contains some input files for simulating the ultrafast demagnetisation of Ni via a heat pulse, using the two-temperature model. This refers to the `laser-pulse` program within vampire. 

You can copy these files to the `working` directory and run vampire there. This will give you an output file called `output`, the contents of which are defined by the input file. 

Plotting this output should allow you to see the phase transition as the Ni demagnetises at the Curie temperature.
