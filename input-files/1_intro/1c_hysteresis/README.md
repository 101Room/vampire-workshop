# Nickel - Hysteresis

This folder contains some input files for running a hysteris loop simulation of Ni. This refers to the `hysteresis-loop` program within vampire. 

You can copy these files to the `working` directory and run vampire there. This will give you an output file called `output`, the contents of which are defined by the input file. 

Plotting this output should allow you to see a the magnetisation switch directions.
