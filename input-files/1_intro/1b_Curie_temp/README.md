# Nickel

Similar to `1a_Ni`, this folder contains some input files for running a temperature sweep of Ni. This refers to the `curie-temperature` program within vampire. 

The input files are left incomplete, with values required for some of the parameters. You should open these files in your text editor and attempt to choose some sensible values for the missing parameters, using `1a_Ni` as a guide.
You can then copy these files to the `working` directory and run vampire there. This will give you an output file called `output`, the contents of which are defined by the input file. 

Plotting this output should allow you to see the phase transition at the Curie temperature.
