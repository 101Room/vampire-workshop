These input files are used to generate a rocksalt structure with two different
elements, in order to demonstrate some tools to visualise the crystal 
structures generated by vampire. 

Throughout, terminal command will be prefaced by $ and will be on their own 
line. 

In order to visualise this material, you should change to your vampire 
directory, for this example, we will assume it is inside the home directory (~)

    $cd  ~/vampire

Then make the vdc utility.

    $make vdc

Once this has completed, you can run vampire inside the directory this file is
inside.

e.g.

    $cd ~/vampire-workshop/input-files/1_intro/1d_visualisation/

Run vampire in this directory

    $ ~/vampire/vampire-serial

When this is completed, you will be able to see spins files, by running ls

    $ ls

That will look like this "spins-00000x.data". In order for programs such as
Rasmol to read these, they must be converted using the vdc utility we built 
earlier

    $ ~/vampire/util/vdc/vdc spins-000000.data

Which will output a "crystal.xyz" file that can be read by RASMOL using

    $ rasmol -xyz crystal.xyz

If you then see a black screen, check that RASMOL is set to "Ball & stick"
or to "Spacefill" in the display menu. 

Finally, assuming that your files are located in the same places as the 
examples in this file you can run this command below to convert and display 
an existing spins-000000.data file in one go. 

    $~/vampire/util/vdc/vdc spins-000000.data && rasmol -xyz crystal.xyz
