Try creating a time series simulation for magnetite at 0K, remember to use 
"config:atoms" to output system spins.

A checklist for the input and material files is available in the corresponding 
"pdf-slides" folder. 

Once you've successfully run this simulation, try changing some of the system 
parameters, such as:
    system size and shape
    number of steps
    simulate faceted nano particles


Following this, you can explore Cobalt ferrite, a related system, with more 
information in the "pdf-slides" folders.
