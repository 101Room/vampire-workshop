# Antiferromagnets 

This folder contains some input files for creating an antiferromagnetic system. The input files will run a field cool simulation from 800K to 0K. This can be used to find the NÃ©el temperature of the material analagous to the Curie temperature of a ferromagnet. 

You can copy these files to the `working` directory and run vampire there. This will give you an output file called `output`, the contents of which are defined by the input file. 

You can then visualise this system, to check that the spins point in alternating directions, and plot the magnetisation against temperature, to find the transition point.
